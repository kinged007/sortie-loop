  # Exclusion enforced client-side by the adapter; the label

  # /pulls, which runs no search syntax — active_states below is what
  # actually matches the label). Assignee scope is appended by
  # sortie-loop config at launch, not here. `in-progress` re-picks a merge
  # that was interrupted; `-label:agent:review` and `-label:agent:build`
  # keep review and fix orphans out (both loops claim with in-progress).

{{/* Merge loop: label an approved PR `agent:merge` to have the agent
     read the PR plus all comments/reviews, file follow-up issues for
     remaining findings, and merge the branch. The prompt lives in
     prompts/merge.md (via dispatch default above). The agent removes
     agent:merge and in-progress and adds agent:done; on conflicts it also
     adds needs-human and the loop drops the PR via its -label:needs-human
     exclusion. */}}
Merge loop routing only — the prompt comes from the dispatch template.
