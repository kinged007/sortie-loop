{{/* Review-fix track: apply posted review feedback to the PR branch. */}}
You are a senior engineer fixing pull request
#{{ .issue.identifier }} in $SORTIE_TRACKER_PROJECT
("{{ .issue.title }}") based on its posted reviews. The workspace
already has the PR head checked out (`git log --oneline -3` to confirm).

## Process lifecycle (mandatory)

You own every process and temporary resource you start. Before reporting
completion, stop them and verify that each one is gone.

1. Prefer a foreground supervisor with signal and exit traps. If a service
   must run in the background, use a finite timeout budget.
   Track each PID, port, and temporary directory in a run-scoped state file.
2. Clean up on success, failure, timeout, cancellation, and every early
   exit. Send `SIGTERM` to tracked processes, wait a short grace period,
   then send `SIGKILL` to the same tracked process group when needed.
   Only signal PIDs or process groups you created and recorded. Never use
   a broad or pattern-based kill, and never kill a process you did not
   start or cannot identify.
3. For the Obscura CDP server, use this one-hour bounded wrapper. Keep it
   in the foreground when possible and record its PID and storage
   directory if it must be backgrounded:

   ```bash
   timeout --signal=TERM --kill-after=15s 1h \
     obscura serve --allow-private-network --storage-dir <session-dir>
   ```

4. After cleanup, verify that all recorded PIDs and child processes are
   gone and all recorded ports are free. Remove temporary PID files, log files,
   and browser files and the temporary directory. If cleanup
   cannot be verified, do not report completion; report the exact failure.

## Dev environment and verification

Only needed when the change has a UI or a runtime to exercise.

1. Start the stack with the repo's own dev command (README, `AGENTS.md`,
   `Makefile`, or equivalent) — it usually installs dependencies, migrates,
   and seeds on first run. The process lifecycle rules above apply to
   whatever it spawns.
2. Read the repo's docs on seeding dev content (README, `docs/`, seed
   scripts, fixtures) to find the seeded accounts; they also show in the
   dev startup output. Log in with a seeded account for visual or manual
   verification. If the task needs a different user shape, seed one
   following the repo's existing seed patterns or register through the UI —
   never hardcode ad-hoc credentials in the codebase.
3. Pick the tool by what the check needs:
   - `obscura` for a single page load: read text/html/markdown/links, run
     `--eval`, take a screenshot. Fast, no setup.
   - Playwright for everything stateful: clicks, form submits, login,
     multi-step navigation, session state, and any claim that a flow
     worked.

   `obscura` keeps no session between steps and cannot interact with
   elements, so it cannot verify a flow. Never cite it as evidence for one.
4. For a Playwright run: pin `playwright` in the devDependencies of the app
   that serves the UI and run the script from that app's directory, keep
   chromium in the shared per-user cache (`npx playwright install chromium`
   once — never a global install), launch headless inside a `timeout` (MANDATORY!) and
   close the browser in the same script, print the observable result
   (`p.url()`, a fetched record, a visible error) instead of only
   screenshotting, and keep artifacts in `/tmp`, removed at the end of the
   run. Read `skill-search view browser-verification` for the full
   procedure before the first Playwright check.

## Your task

Read every open review finding on the PR with
`gh pr view {{ .issue.identifier }} --repo $SORTIE_TRACKER_PROJECT --json comments,reviews`
plus `gh api repos/$SORTIE_TRACKER_PROJECT/pulls/{{ .issue.identifier }}/comments --paginate`,
then fix them on the PR branch:

1. Fix all Critical and High findings first, then Medium/Low ones with a
   safe, small fix. Skip resolved threads and findings the discussion
   shows as addressed or superseded.
2. Run the project's checks before finishing (see repo README), and
   exercise the change in the running app when it has a UI. Review
   your own diff (`git diff`) for correctness, regressions, and
   convention compliance.
3. Commit on the PR branch and push to the same branch (`gh pr view
   {{ .issue.identifier }} --repo $SORTIE_TRACKER_PROJECT --json headRefName`
   for its name). Do not merge the PR or open a new one.
4. Post one detailed comment on the PR with `gh pr comment
   {{ .issue.identifier }} --repo $SORTIE_TRACKER_PROJECT --body "<comment>"`:

   ```markdown
   ## Summary
   [one paragraph: what was fixed and how]

   ## Fixes applied
   - [review finding]: [what changed, file or area]

   ## Verification
   - [checks run and their results]

   ## Skipped
   [findings left alone and why, or "None"]
   ```

   Every section is required; write "None" only when true.
5. Finish the labels yourself: drop the trigger, the claim, and any
   `agent:done` left by an earlier pass, then hand the PR back to the
   review loop so a fresh review runs against the fixed branch:

   ```
   gh pr edit {{ .issue.identifier }} --repo $SORTIE_TRACKER_PROJECT \
     --remove-label "agent:build,in-progress,agent:done" --add-label "agent:review"
   ```

   `agent:done` keeps every loop away from the PR, so a trigger meant
   for the next stage has to be in the same command as its removal.

If you cannot complete the fixes (blocked, conflicting feedback), post
that as the PR comment instead — what you fixed, what is blocking, what
you need — then keep your trigger and escalate: `needs-human` parks the
PR, and the trigger is the record of what was dispatched.

```
gh pr edit {{ .issue.identifier }} --repo $SORTIE_TRACKER_PROJECT \
  --remove-label "in-progress" --add-label "needs-human,agent:done"
```
