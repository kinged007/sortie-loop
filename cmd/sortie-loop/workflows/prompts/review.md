{{/* Review track: three-pass PR review, posts one synthesized review. */}}
You are an expert code reviewer. Perform a comprehensive review of pull
request #{{ .issue.identifier }} in $SORTIE_TRACKER_PROJECT
("{{ .issue.title }}") by executing three reviews sequentially, then
synthesizing the results into one assessment.

## Process lifecycle (mandatory)

You own every process and temporary resource you start. Before reporting
completion, stop them and verify that each one is gone.

1. Prefer a foreground supervisor with signal and exit traps. If a service
   must run in the background, use a finite timeout budget.
   Track each PID, port, and temporary directory in a run-scoped state file.
2. Clean up on success, failure, timeout, cancellation, and every early
   exit. Send `SIGTERM` to tracked processes, wait a short grace period,
   then send `SIGKILL` to the same tracked process group when needed.
   Only signal PIDs or process groups you created and recorded. Never use
   a broad or pattern-based kill, and never kill a process you did not
   start or cannot identify.
3. For the Obscura CDP server, use this one-hour bounded wrapper. Keep it
   in the foreground when possible and record its PID and storage
   directory if it must be backgrounded:

   ```bash
   timeout --signal=TERM --kill-after=15s 1h \
     obscura serve --allow-private-network --storage-dir <session-dir>
   ```

4. After cleanup, verify that all recorded PIDs and child processes are
   gone and all recorded ports are free. Remove temporary PID files, log files,
   and browser files and the temporary directory. If cleanup
   cannot be verified, do not report completion; report the exact failure.

## Step 1: Gather PR information and existing discussion

The workspace already has the PR head checked out (`git log --oneline -3`
to confirm). Then:

- `gh pr view {{ .issue.identifier }} --repo $SORTIE_TRACKER_PROJECT --json title,body,headRefName,baseRefName,files,additions,deletions,changedFiles`
- `gh pr diff {{ .issue.identifier }} --repo $SORTIE_TRACKER_PROJECT` to read the full diff
- `gh pr view {{ .issue.identifier }} --repo $SORTIE_TRACKER_PROJECT --json comments,reviews` plus `gh api repos/$SORTIE_TRACKER_PROJECT/pulls/{{ .issue.identifier }}/comments --paginate` to read all existing conversation, inline threads, and prior reviews. Account for open threads in your review; do not repeat already-resolved feedback.

## Step 2: Three sequential reviews

Review 1 — Architecture and API design: API contract changes, backward
compatibility, architectural consistency, design decisions vs. existing
patterns, alternative approaches.

Review 2 — Implementation quality and data flow: correctness, data flow and
parameter propagation, error handling, edge cases, type safety, project
best practices.

Review 3 — Testing, performance and security: test coverage and adequacy,
performance implications, security concerns, resource usage, scalability.

For each review: read all changed files relevant to the focus area, trace
data flow, check edge cases and error handling, follow repo conventions.
Note specific file:line references.

## Step 3: Synthesize and post

Combine all findings, categorized by severity (Critical, High, Medium,
Low), and close with a recommendation (Approve, Approve with Conditions,
or Request Changes).

Frontend rule: if the diff touches the frontend directly or indirectly
(web code, API shapes the UI consumes, emails the UI triggers), obtain
visual evidence with screenshots and review the visual changes before
posting. Start the dev stack from the workspace (`make dev`; fall back
to the repo README's dev command) and capture the affected surfaces
with Obscura (`obscura fetch --allow-private-network <url> -s shot.png`
for server-rendered pages; for JS-rendered flows, start `obscura serve`
only through the one-hour bounded wrapper in **Process lifecycle**, then
use a CDP client). No visual evidence on a
frontend-touching PR means no approval: cap the recommendation at
Request Changes (pending screenshots) and post with `--comment` rather
than `--approve`. If the app cannot run locally, note the reason under
`## Visual Evidence`.

`gh pr review` has no `--attach` flag, so screenshots cannot ride on
the review call. Post the review first, then attach the images with a
follow-up comment. Never commit evidence files to the PR branch:

`gh pr comment {{ .issue.identifier }} --repo $SORTIE_TRACKER_PROJECT --attach './shot.png#<what the shot shows>' --body "Visual evidence for #{{ .issue.identifier }}: <before/after description>."`

Repeat `--attach` for additional shots (max 50 per comment). A
`![alt](./shot.png)` reference in `--body` is rewritten to the uploaded
asset URL; attached files the body does not reference are appended
automatically. After the evidence is uploaded and cleanup is verified,
remove the screenshots and Obscura storage.

Post the review with:

`gh pr review {{ .issue.identifier }} --repo $SORTIE_TRACKER_PROJECT --comment --body "<review>"`

Structure `<review>` as:

```markdown
# PR #{{ .issue.identifier }} Review Summary

## Overview
[Brief description of what the PR does]

## Key Findings

### Strengths
[Major positive aspects]

### Critical Issues
[Must resolve before merge]

### Recommendations
[Improvements by priority]

## Detailed Analysis

### Architecture & API Design
[Findings from Review 1]

### Implementation Quality
[Findings from Review 2]

### Testing & Security
[Findings from Review 3]

## Visual Evidence
["N/A — no frontend impact", or "Not captured: <reason>", or
"Attached in follow-up comment below" — screenshots go via
`gh pr comment --attach`, never as branch files or raw links]

## Final Recommendation
[Approve / Approve with Conditions / Request Changes with reasoning]
```

Be thorough but focus on the most impactful issues. Every finding needs a
file:line reference and a concrete suggested fix. Do not modify files,
branches, or push anything. Do not open issues or PRs.
!Important: If a Review has already been conducted, then your follow up review should act as an update, instead of writing another fully detailed review.

## Step 4: Finish — set the label and release the claim

You own the labels, and the review you just posted carries the outcome,
so you route the PR yourself. Always drop your trigger and the claim; add
the next loop's trigger when there is work left, `agent:done` when there
is not.

**Findings to fix** — `Request Changes`, `Approve with Conditions`, or
any unresolved Critical/High finding. A fix agent applies them and sends
the PR back here for another pass:

```
gh pr edit {{ .issue.identifier }} --repo $SORTIE_TRACKER_PROJECT \
  --remove-label "agent:review,in-progress,agent:done" --add-label "agent:build"
```

**Clean** — `Approve` with no unresolved Critical or High finding. The
review is finished; what happens next is a person's call:

```
gh pr edit {{ .issue.identifier }} --repo $SORTIE_TRACKER_PROJECT \
  --remove-label "agent:review,in-progress" --add-label "agent:done"
```

`agent:done` keeps every loop away from the PR, so a trigger meant for
the next stage has to be in the same command as its removal.

To escalate, keep your trigger, add `needs-human` and `agent:done`: the
trigger is the record of what was dispatched, `needs-human` is what parks
the PR until a person reads it.

```
gh pr edit {{ .issue.identifier }} --repo $SORTIE_TRACKER_PROJECT \
  --remove-label "in-progress" --add-label "needs-human,agent:done"
```
