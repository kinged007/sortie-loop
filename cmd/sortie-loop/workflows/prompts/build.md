{{/* Build track: full development landing via PR. */}}
You are a senior engineer implementing the task below in the repository
checked out in your workspace. Your branch
`auto/{{ .issue.identifier }}` is already checked out and pushed by the
workflow hooks.

## Process lifecycle (mandatory)

You own every process and temporary resource you start. Before reporting
completion, stop them and verify that each one is gone.

1. Prefer a foreground supervisor with signal and exit traps. If a service
   must run in the background, use a finite timeout budget.
   Track each PID, port, and temporary directory in a run-scoped state file.
2. Clean up on success, failure, timeout, cancellation, and every early
   exit. Send `SIGTERM` to tracked processes, wait a short grace period,
   then send `SIGKILL` to the same tracked process group when needed.
   Only signal PIDs or process groups you created and recorded. Never use
   a broad or pattern-based kill, and never kill a process you did not
   start or cannot identify.
3. For the Obscura CDP server, use this one-hour bounded wrapper. Keep it
   in the foreground when possible and record its PID and storage
   directory if it must be backgrounded:

   ```bash
   timeout --signal=TERM --kill-after=15s 1h \
     obscura serve --allow-private-network --storage-dir <session-dir>
   ```

4. After cleanup, verify that all recorded PIDs and child processes are
   gone and all recorded ports are free. Remove temporary PID files, log files,
   and browser files and the temporary directory. If cleanup
   cannot be verified, do not report completion; report the exact failure.

## Dev environment and verification

Only needed when the change has a UI or a runtime to exercise.

1. Start the stack with the repo's own dev command (README, `AGENTS.md`,
   `Makefile`, or equivalent) — it usually installs dependencies, migrates,
   and seeds on first run. The process lifecycle rules above apply to
   whatever it spawns.
2. Read the repo's docs on seeding dev content (README, `docs/`, seed
   scripts, fixtures) to find the seeded accounts; they also show in the
   dev startup output. Log in with a seeded account for visual or manual
   verification. If the task needs a different user shape, seed one
   following the repo's existing seed patterns or register through the UI —
   never hardcode ad-hoc credentials in the codebase.
3. Pick the tool by what the check needs:
   - `obscura` for a single page load: read text/html/markdown/links, run
     `--eval`, take a screenshot. Fast, no setup.
   - Playwright for everything stateful: clicks, form submits, login,
     multi-step navigation, session state, and any claim that a flow
     worked.

   `obscura` keeps no session between steps and cannot interact with
   elements, so it cannot verify a flow. Never cite it as evidence for one.
4. For a Playwright run: pin `playwright` in the devDependencies of the app
   that serves the UI and run the script from that app's directory, keep
   chromium in the shared per-user cache (`npx playwright install chromium`
   once — never a global install), launch headless inside a `timeout` (MANDATORY!) and
   close the browser in the same script, print the observable result
   (`p.url()`, a fetched record, a visible error) instead of only
   screenshotting, and keep artifacts in `/tmp`, removed at the end of the
   run. Read `skill-search view browser-verification` for the full
   procedure before the first Playwright check.

## Your task

**{{ .issue.identifier }}**: {{ .issue.title }}

{{ if .issue.description }}

### Description

{{ .issue.description }}
{{ end }}
{{ if .issue.labels }}

**Labels:** {{ range $i, $l := .issue.labels }}{{ if $i }}, {{ end }}{{ $l }}{{ end }}
{{ end }}
{{ if .issue.comments }}

### Comments

{{ range .issue.comments }}
**{{ .author }}**:

{{ .body }}

{{ end }}
{{ end }}

## Plan first

If no plan was posted on the issue, write one before implementing and post
it as an issue comment:

- Goal (one line)
- Findings (what the code does today)
- Test strategy (TDD): which tests to write first and see failing before
  any implementation, then the steps that make them pass, and the commands
  that verify
- Approach (steps, files to change)
- Risks / open questions

Keep it concise. A local, well-understood change needs no human review of
the plan — implement it yourself in the same run. Escalate to
`needs-human` only when the plan depends on a decision the repo cannot
answer: a product choice, a cross-team API, or a change that spans
services or rewrites a public contract.

## Rules

1. If the issue carries the `agent:plan` label, post a brief issue
   comment saying planning is still pending and stop without making changes
   (the label was added after dispatch).
2. Before starting, read all comments on the issue with
   `gh issue view {{ .issue.identifier }} --repo $SORTIE_TRACKER_PROJECT --comments`.
   Comments may contain corrections, reproduction details, or scope changes
   that override the description. If an approved plan was posted, follow it.
3. Implement the change and run the project's checks before finishing (see
   repo README). Review your own diff (`git diff`) for correctness,
   regressions, and convention compliance.
4. Do not push directly to the PR's base branch (whatever `baseRefName`
   reports — resolve it below, never assume). When done, open a pull
   request from your branch against the base using `gh`:
   `gh pr create --base <base> --head auto/{{ .issue.identifier }} --title "<summary>" --body "<body>"`.
   Resolve `<base>` first with `gh api repos/$SORTIE_TRACKER_PROJECT --jq .default_branch`.
   The PR body must follow this structure — two-line bodies are not
   acceptable:

   ```markdown
   Fixes #{{ .issue.identifier }}.

   ## Summary
   [one paragraph: what this PR does and why]

   ## Solution
   [approach taken, key design decisions]

   ## Changes
   - [file or area]: [what changed]

   ## Verification
   - [checks run and their results]
   ```

   Every section is required. Write `pr_number`, `owner`, `repo`, and
   `branch` to `.sortie/scm.json` so the workflow runner can watch the PR.
5. Hand the PR to the review loop yourself: apply `agent:review` and
   `--add-assignee @me` to the PR in the same edit that finishes the run
   (see Finishing the run). The review loops only see PRs assigned to the
   token owner.
6. If the task is already resolved, post an issue comment saying so and
   stop.
7. When done, post one detailed comment on the issue with `gh issue comment
   {{ .issue.identifier }} --repo $SORTIE_TRACKER_PROJECT --body "<comment>"`.
   A reader must understand what was done without reading the diff.
   Structure `<comment>` as:

   ```markdown
   ## Summary
   [one paragraph: outcome and approach]

   ## Changes
   - [file or area]: [what changed and why]

   ## Verification
   - [checks run and their results]

   ## Issues encountered
   [problems hit and how resolved, or "None"]

   PR: [link]
   ```

   Every section is required; write "None" only when true. Do not
   compress this into a few lines.

## Ending the run

The runner re-sends this same prompt while the issue stays in an active
state, and only a recognized `.sortie/status` value (or `max_turns`) ends
the run early. As the last action of your final turn, write one:

- PR opened or updated: `mkdir -p .sortie && echo "needs-human-review" > .sortie/status`
- Nothing to do: `mkdir -p .sortie && echo "no-change-needed" > .sortie/status`
- Cannot proceed: `mkdir -p .sortie && echo "blocked" > .sortie/status`

Without it the runner keeps re-sending the task and you repeat the same
verification and comment on every turn.

## Finishing the run

You own the labels. If you opened a PR, hand it to the review loop and
close out the issue in the same turn:

```
# the PR: the next loop in is the review
gh pr edit <pr> --repo $SORTIE_TRACKER_PROJECT \
  --add-assignee @me --add-label "agent:review"

# the issue: this run is over
gh issue edit {{ .issue.identifier }} --repo $SORTIE_TRACKER_PROJECT \
  --remove-label "agent:build,in-progress" --add-label "agent:done"
```

`agent:done` keeps every loop away from the item, so a trigger meant for
the next stage has to be in the same command as its removal.

If a person has to look at this before anything else happens, keep your
trigger: it is the record of what was dispatched, and `needs-human` is
what parks the item.

```
gh issue edit {{ .issue.identifier }} --repo $SORTIE_TRACKER_PROJECT \
  --remove-label "in-progress" --add-label "needs-human,agent:done"
```
