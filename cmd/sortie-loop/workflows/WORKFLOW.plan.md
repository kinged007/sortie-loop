{{/* Plan loop: issues labeled `agent:plan`. Prompt lives in
     prompts/plan.md (via dispatch default above): research the issue,
     post the plan as an issue comment, write no code. The agent removes
     agent:plan and adds agent:done; a human reviews the plan and labels
     the issue `agent:build` to trigger development. The body below never
     renders; it documents the routing. */}}
Plan loop routing only — the prompt comes from the dispatch template.
