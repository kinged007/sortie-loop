## Build and check

```sh
go build ./... && go vet ./... && gofmt -l cmd internal && go test ./...
```

Go 1.26.0 or newer. CI runs the same commands, plus a build matrix for
linux and darwin on amd64 and arm64. Windows is not a target.

## Tests

`go test ./...`, no framework and no external services. Tests that need an
engine find one on `PATH` or in the cache and skip when there is none, so
CI does not have to install the engine. `TestSortieValidate` is the
exception: it runs the pinned fork's engine when one is present, because
the shipped workflows are only valid against an engine that has the `pi`
adapter and the `github-pr` tracker.

`release_config_test.go` asserts the contract between `install.sh` and
`.goreleaser.yaml`. If you change either asset name, change both.

## Commits

Conventional Commits. One concern per commit — a behavioural fix and a
docs rewrite in the same commit make a bisect useless.

## Engine

The engine is the [kinged007/sortie](https://github.com/kinged007/sortie)
fork, not `sortie-ai/sortie`. See [SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md) for why.
Changes to the engine belong in that repository, not here; this repository
only pins a version.

Bumping `engineTag` in `cmd/sortie-loop/version.go` is the whole change,
but it is not free: the workflows are written against known engine
behaviour, so a bump needs `sortie validate` run against the new engine
with the shipped workflows. `go test ./...` covers that when an engine is
on `PATH`.
