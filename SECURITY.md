## What this tool does

`sortie-loop` runs autonomous coding agents against a GitHub repository.
Each loop watches for issues and pull requests carrying a trigger label,
clones the repository into a scratch workspace, and hands the item to a
coding agent. The agent reads files, edits code, runs commands, commits,
pushes branches, opens pull requests, and moves labels.

**The agent is a program that executes with your credentials.** Treat
enabling a loop as equivalent to giving a person shell access to your
machine and write access to your repository, because in effect that is
what it does.

## The trust model

Three things run on your machine, and you are trusting all of them.

1. **`sortie-loop`** — this tool. Sets up config, labels and workflows,
   then supervises one engine process per loop and serves a local
   dashboard.
2. **The engine** — the [sortie](https://github.com/sortie-ai/sortie)
   binary. It polls GitHub, claims work, clones the repository, and hands
   each item to an agent. `sortie-loop` pins a specific release and
   verifies the download against that release's `checksums.txt`.
3. **The agent** — a coding agent such as [pi](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono).
   This is the component that reads your files and runs your commands.

The shipped workflows need two pieces the upstream engine does not
ship: the **pi agent adapter** and the **github-pr tracker** (which
treats pull requests as work items). They are provided by the
[kinged007/sortie](https://github.com/kinged007/sortie) fork, so
installing `sortie-loop` means running a fork. `SORTIE_ENGINE_REPO`
points the installer at a different build of the same engine; whatever
it points at must still carry both adapters. Building the engine from
source is the way to read the code you are about to execute.

## Token scope

One token is the identity of both the loop and the agent. It
authenticates GitHub API polling, label changes, clones of private
repositories, and every `gh` command the agent runs.

A loop that can read an issue can act on it, and a token that can push
to `main` means a misbehaving or confused agent can push to `main`.
Prefer the narrowest scope that works:

- **Fine-grained tokens** over classic ones. Grant access only to the
  repositories you loop over, with **Contents: read and write**, plus
  **Issues: read and write** and **Pull requests: read and write**.
  Omit everything else, and set a short expiry.
- **A separate bot account** keeps agent commits, comments and pull
  requests off your personal name, and lets you revoke access without
  affecting your own credentials.
- **Branch protection is your last line of defence.** Require review and
  require CI to pass, so a merged agent branch still cannot reach the
  default branch without a person.

The token is read from the first of `SORTIE_LOOP_TOKEN`, `token:` in
`.sortie/config.yaml`, `GITHUB_TOKEN`, `GH_TOKEN`. It is written to
`.sortie/.env.loop` with mode `0600` and passed to engine processes in
their environment, so it is readable by your user account and appears in
`/proc/<pid>/environ`. Do not put a token in `token:` in a config file
you track in git.

## The dashboard

The dashboard binds to `127.0.0.1` only and has no authentication, so it
is reachable by any process running as you and by nothing else. It
renders issue titles and agent output from GitHub. Do not port-forward or
proxy it to a network you do not control without putting authentication
in front of it.

## Running the loops

The agent runs whatever the workflow tells it to, including the project's
own test and build commands. In practice:

- Give a loop a repository you are willing to have modified, not your
  only copy of important work.
- Start with a label and one issue. Watch what it does before queueing a
  backlog.
- Read the summary comments the agents post. `needs-human` means an
  agent stopped and wants you.
- Loops merge pull requests when labelled `agent:merge`. Nothing applies
  that label automatically; a person or the PM prompt does.

## Reporting a vulnerability

Report a security issue privately by opening a
[GitHub security advisory](https://github.com/kinged007/sortie-loop/security/advisories/new)
on this repository rather than a public issue. Include the version, the
platform, and what an attacker would gain.
